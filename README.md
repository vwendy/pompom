# pompom
R package to perform time-series analysis and guage the temporal influence from one variable to another. 

We created an R package named "pompom" (pompom is the initials of person-oriented modeling and perturbation on the model), and we will use the functions in "pompom" to compute iRAM (impulse response analysis metric) in this pacakge. 

iRAM is built upon a hybrid method that combines intraindividual variability methods and network analysis methods in order to model individuals as high-dimensional dynamic systems. This hybrid method is designed and tested to quantify the extent of interaction in a high-dimensional multivariate system, and applicable on experience sampling data.
