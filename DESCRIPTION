Description: An implementation of a hybrid method of person-oriented method 
    and perturbation on the model. The hybrid method will provide a multivariate
    intraindividual variability metric (iRAM). The person-oriented method refers to uSEM 
    (unified structural equation modeling), and perturbation was conducted according to
    the impulse response analysis.
